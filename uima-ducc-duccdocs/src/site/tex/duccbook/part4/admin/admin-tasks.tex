\section{Administrative Tasks}

   The administrative tasks comprise one or several DUCC commands 
   and/or file editing to achieve a desired system state.

\subsection{Add Node}
\label{subsec:admin.add-node}

	\subsubsection{{\em Description}}
    Persistently add a node to active service in the cluster.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item add the node to file resources/ducc.nodes
      \item add the node to file resources/ducc.classes (optional)
      \item run admin/start\_ducc agent@<host.domain>
      \item run admin/rm\_qoccupancy
    \end{itemize}

	The node should start appearing in the results from the
	rm\_qoccupancy command, perhaps with some delay due to
	system latency.
	
\subsection{Remove Node}
\label{subsec:admin.remove-node}

    \subsubsection{{\em Description}}
    Persistently remove a node from active service in the cluster.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item remove the node from file resources/ducc.nodes
      \item remove the node to file resources/ducc.classes (if specified)
      \item run admin/stop\_ducc agent@<host.domain>
      \item run admin/rm\_reconfigure
      \item run admin/rm\_qoccupancy
    \end{itemize}

	The node should stop appearing in the results from the
	rm\_qoccupancy command, perhaps with some delay due to
	system latency.
